# üëãüèº I'm Alishba

Welcome to my quirky corner of the internet, where cybersecurity isn‚Äôt just a profession, but an exhilarating adventure! Here, I document my thrilling journey through the world of CTFs, binary exploitation, and memory forensics. Expect a playful mix of in-depth technical insights, whimsical storytelling, and a sprinkle of hacker humor.

Imagine playing hide and seek, but the hiders are sneaky malware and the seeker is... me! Armed with nothing but curiosity, a keyboard, and way too much coffee, I chase down digital villains and crack the tough puzzles. 
Come along on my adventure as I crack codes, solve mysteries, and have a blast in the world of cybersecurity!

Remember : Every byte tells a story.

Happy hunting!
